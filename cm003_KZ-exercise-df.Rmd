## R Markdown
$$\alpha = 5 + 2$$
Inline equation $\alpha = 5 + 2$

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#converts R markdown to HTML
#integreation between r code and a document, you can write an analysis and demonstrate it as you analyze it

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
```{r}
```

#Insert R is a co-chunk
#use a comma to bring up chunk options 
#```{rcars, }
## Including Plots

#R notebook vs markdown: only difference is that the execution of commands... r code is ran within notebook and renders html. Markdown knits and clears the directory then executes everything from top to bottom

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.width=3, fig/.height=3}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
